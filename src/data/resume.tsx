    "Full-Stack Developer focused on building scalable, practical applications.",
  summary:
    "After completing my A-levels in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Computer Science (with full marks on the CS NEA project), I dove into professional development through certifications and real-world work. I earned the IBM Back-End Development Specialisation on Coursera and completed Udemy courses in Python, full-stack web development, and web technologies. At INK Design Studio, I built two major applications from scratch: CreateMore (an ERP tool for project management) and FileTank (a multi-tenant file sharing platform). I'm based in London and looking to leverage my practical skills in junior full-stack or software engineering roles.",
